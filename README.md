# Revisiting Webpack: Redoing a Restaurant Page

## Reflection

### Lessons & Difficulties

The documentation is often difficult to parse and understand.

### Diary

I have dreaded Webpack since first reading about it. Using it was painful, overly complicated, and my challenge to take on. It is a useful piece of technology, and I must learn it.

Webpack is not as daunting as before, but it truly is complicated, and its benefits are not always obvious or immediate. Reading the documentation, I often find myself asking, "What about this particular case?"
